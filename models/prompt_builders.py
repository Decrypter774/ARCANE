            - The lesson's length MUST be calibrated for a {lesson_duration}-minute completion time for an average student. A shorter duration means a more concise, high-level overview. A longer duration allows for more depth, detail, and examples.
            - Use concise, easy-to-understand language for learners at various levels.

            Visual Aids:
            - Insert AI image placeholders only when the visual would enhance understanding.
            - All images must follow this format exactly:
              [IMAGE_PROMPT: "A grayscale, schematic-style diagram with no text, showing ..."]

            [IMAGE_PROMPT: "A grayscale, schematic-style diagram with no text, showing the layers of a neural network"]

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any text in the images themselves, as the AI image generator struggles with rendering text in images. I want the images to be a grayscale, schematic diagram.

            The lesson should be clear, logically organized, and visually supported where appropriate.
