            Your task:

            You are an expert AI tutor.

            Generate a comprehensive, structured, and beginner-friendly lesson on the topic: "{lesson_title}".
            This lesson is part of the unit: "{unit_title}".

            Guidelines:
            - Use clear Markdown formatting (## Headings, bullet points, code blocks if needed).
            - Include step-by-step explanations, illustrative examples, and analogies.
            - The content should be suitable for a {lesson_duration}-minute self-paced lesson.
            - Use concise, easy-to-understand language for learners at various levels.

            Visual Aids:
            - Insert AI image placeholders only when the visual would enhance understanding.
            - All images must follow this format exactly:
              [IMAGE_PROMPT: "A grayscale, schematic-style diagram with no text, showing ..."]

            Example:
            [IMAGE_PROMPT: "A grayscale, schematic-style diagram with no text, showing the layers of a neural network"]

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any text in the images themselves, as the AI image generator struggles with rendering text in images. I want the images to be a grayscale, schematic diagram.

            The lesson should be clear, logically organized, and visually supported where appropriate.
